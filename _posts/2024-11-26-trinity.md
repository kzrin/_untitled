->*[trinity wiki][wiki]*


made a fun build by subsuming roar (71% dmg increase with molt vigor) and equpping a tenet glaxion modded for viral & heat status. I can oneshot most heavy units on steel path by applying viral stacks with the glaxion and pressing 2 while roar is active, while also being a decent support. 

it's simple and feels more balanced and comfortable to use compared to a negative duration build which does a better job at oneshotting heavy units.


> the build:

>> *(trinity prime and tenet glaxion)*
>> ![trinity build][trinity]
>> ![glaxion build][glaxion]


> shards:

>> *(all duration)*
>> ![archon shards][trinity_main]

> focus school:

>> vazarin (for affinity range)
